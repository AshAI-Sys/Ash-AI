## üö® COORDINATION PROTOCOLS

### **For New Claude Instances:**
When you create new Claude instances, give them this instruction:

```
"You are Claude Instance #[X] - [ROLE] working on ASH AI ERP system.

Report to the MASTER COORDINATOR Claude for all assignments.

Your role: [Backend/Production/Frontend/AI/HR-Finance/Testing]

FIRST ACTION: Ask the Coordinator for your current task assignment and wait for specific instructions before starting any work.

Never work independently - always get Coordinator approval first."
```

### **Communication Protocol:**
- **All instances report to ME (Coordinator)**
- **No direct coordination between instances**
- **I handle all conflict resolution**
- **I manage all integration points**
- **I assign specific tasks daily**

### **Quality Control:**
- Each instance reports completion before moving to next task
- I verify all work before approving next steps
- I test integration points before phase transitions
- I maintain overall code quality standards
