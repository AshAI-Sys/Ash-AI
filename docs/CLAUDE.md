## Database Schema Architecture

The system uses a comprehensive Prisma schema organized by manufacturing stages:

### Core Entities
- **Workspace**: Multi-tenant support
- **User**: System authentication and roles
- **Client/Brand**: Customer and brand management
- **Order**: Purchase orders with routing workflows

### Manufacturing Stages
1. **Client & Order Intake**: Order creation and management
2. **Design & Approval**: Asset management and client approvals
3. **Cutting System**: Fabric cutting with optimization
4. **Printing System**: Multi-method printing (Silkscreen, Sublimation, DTF, Embroidery)
5. **Sewing System**: Operations with piece-rate tracking
6. **Quality Control**: AQL-based inspection system
7. **Finishing & Packing**: Final assembly and packaging
8. **Delivery Management**: Driver and 3PL logistics

### Support Systems
- **Finance**: Complete AR/AP system with BIR compliance, VAT returns, withholding tax, financial reporting
- **HR**: Comprehensive employee management with Philippine compliance (SSS, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG, TIN)
- **Maintenance**: Equipment and facility management
- **Client Portal**: Self-service customer interface with real-time order tracking
- **AI Assistant**: Ashley AI providing manufacturing insights, production optimization, and demand forecasting

## Development Guidelines

### Authentication
- Uses mock authentication in development with predefined users
- Test credentials: admin@example.com / admin123
- Role-based access control with comprehensive Role enum

### API Structure
- All API routes follow RESTful patterns
- Located in `src/app/api/[module]/`
- Use Prisma for database operations
- Implement proper error handling and validation

### Component Organization
- UI components in `src/components/ui/`
- Feature-specific components grouped by domain
- Multiple dashboard variants (Modern, Professional, Clean, etc.)

### Styling Approach
- Tailwind CSS with custom neural/cyber theme
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Component-based styling with shadcn/ui patterns
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

### State Management
- React Context for global state (Providers component)
- Server state managed through API routes
- Client state using React hooks

## Key Files and Configurations

### Database
- **prisma/schema.prisma**: Comprehensive schema with 50+ models
- **src/lib/prisma.ts**: Database client configuration
- **src/lib/db.ts**: Database utilities

### Authentication
- **src/lib/auth.ts**: NextAuth configuration with mock users
- **src/app/api/auth/**: Authentication API routes

### Business Logic
- **src/lib/po-generator.ts**: Purchase order number generation
- **src/lib/routing-engine.ts**: Manufacturing routing logic
- **src/lib/*-calculations.ts**: Various calculation utilities

### UI Components
- **src/components/ui/**: Reusable UI components
- **src/components/Layout.tsx**: Main application layout
- **src/app/providers.tsx**: React context providers

## Important Considerations

### Performance
- Uses Next.js 15 optimizations (turbopack, optimized imports)
- Bundle analysis available via `npm run analyze`
- Image optimization configured
- Static optimization enabled

### Security
- Field-level encryption for PII mentioned in architecture
- RBAC implementation through Role enum
- Audit logging system (AuditLog model)

### Philippine Compliance
- BIR (Bureau of Internal Revenue) tax compliance
- Philippine employment law compliance in HR module
- Government ID fields (SSS, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG, TIN)

### Development Notes

### Phase Structure
1. **Phase 1**: Backend Foundation (Database, APIs, Authentication)
2. **Phase 2**: Production Workflows (Manufacturing automation)
3. **Phase 3**: Frontend UI/UX (TikTok-style responsive design)
4. **Phase 4**: AI Integration (Ashley AI + Real-time features)
5. **Phase 5**: HR & Finance (Employee management + BIR compliance)
